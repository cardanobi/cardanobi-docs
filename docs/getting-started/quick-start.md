# Let's code...or not

The quickest way to get started is with the **CardanoBI SaaS API**.

### What you'll need

- An API Key & Secret
- A shell terminal
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above


## Getting your API Key & Secret

<!-- To take part in our alpha, please email us at [info@cardanobi.io](mailto:info@cardanobi.io) and we'll reply with your key details. -->

To get your free API key, go over to [cardanobi.io](https://cardanobi.io/)

Hit the login link in the top right corner.

Then either:

- Register with your email
- Authenticate with Google
- Authenticate Github

Once registered/authenticated you will be redirected to your dashboard:

Hit the `Add Project` button to create your first project.

Choose a fitting name, the desired Cardano network (mainnet & preprod are live, preview is in the making :fire:)

:::tip

Note that in the rest of this `quick start` we will be using the mainnet API, so if you want to follow along maybe best to create a mainnet API key :bulb:.

:::

Hit the `Save` button.

At this stage you should be prompted with your own `API key` and `API secret`.

:::caution

Make sure to save the secret right away as it will disappear from view upon refreshing your page.

:::

You are all set!


## Making your first call

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="shell" label="Shell">

Open a shell terminal and run the following.

- Get a Bearer token from CardanoBI's mainnet identity server:

```shell
curl -d "client_id=YOUR-KEY&client_secret=YOUR-SECRET&grant_type=client_credentials" -X POST https://cardanobi.io:44010/connect/token
```

:::tip

Don't forget to replace the placeholders with your actual API key and secret.

:::

- Make your first request by looking up the latest block on mainnet:

```shell
curl https://cardanobi.io:4000/api/core/blocks/latest -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-BEARER-TOKEN" -H "Client-Api-Key: YOUR-API-KEY" | jq .
```

:::tip

Don't forget to replace the placeholder with your actual Bearer token.

:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="js" label="Node.js">

Install our Node.js SDK
```
$ git clone https://github.com/cardanobi/cardanobi-js.git
cd cardanobi-js
npm install
```

Import CardanoBI.js in your project.
```js
import { CardanoBI } from './cardanobi-js/CardanoBI.js'
```

Now make your first request by looking up the latest block on mainnet:
```js
const CBI = await new CardanoBI({ apiKey: "YOUR-KEY", apiSecret: "YOUR-SECRET"});
const block = await CBI.core.blocks.latest_();
console.log(block);
```

:::tip

Don't forget to replace the placeholders with your actual API key and secret.
