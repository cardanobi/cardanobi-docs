### 🌟 Release Announcement: CardanoBI SDKs Now Available!

We are excited to announce the official release of our Python and Rust SDKs for the CardanoBI API! These tools are now available to all developers and enthusiasts looking to integrate and build on the Cardano blockchain more efficiently.

#### 🐍 Python SDK Released
The Python SDK is designed to offer Python developers easy and flexible integration with the Cardano blockchain. Whether you're building dApps, analyzing data, or automating transactions, this SDK provides all the necessary tools to get started.

**Explore the Python SDK on GitHub:** [CardanoBI Python SDK](https://github.com/cardanobi/cardanobi-python)

#### 🦀 Rust SDK Released
For those who require high performance and reliability, our Rust SDK is now available. It's perfect for developing secure and scalable blockchain solutions.

**Check out the Rust SDK on GitHub:** [CardanoBI Rust SDK](https://github.com/cardanobi/cardanobi-rust)

#### 🚀 Features and Capabilities
Both SDKs, similar to our initial [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/cardanobi/cardanobi-js), offer developers access to all of CardanoBI API endpoints across three critical domains: 
1. **Core Domain** - Direct access to all on-chain data of Cardano (accounts, blocks, transactions, contracts...) enabling foundational blockchain functions and interactions.
2. **Business Intelligence Domain** - Provides derived data from the Core, offering valuable data analysis and statistical insights to enhance strategic decision-making.
3. **Partner Domain** - Provides insights into the business value outcome of companies/projects building utilities on Cardano. It combines on-chain and off-chain data and serves as the data layer to power the `Bloombergs` of Cardano.

These SDKs are packed with features designed to make blockchain development straightforward and accessible. They include comprehensive documentation and examples to help you get started quickly.

#### 🔗 Get Involved
We encourage developers to dive into the SDKs, experiment with them, and contribute to their continuous improvement. Your feedback and contributions are invaluable to us!
