As our open alpha is going well and gathering pace, we are excited to announce that our open beta will aim to start on 30 May 2023.

:::caution
Open alpha API Keys won't be ported over as we're introducing client authentication into the mix.

But do not worry, we will be supporting your favourite auth providers, so registering for the open beta will take less time than spelling Oompa Loompa.

One added bonus is that you will be all set for the official production launch!
