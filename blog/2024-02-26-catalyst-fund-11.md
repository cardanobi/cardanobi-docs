### 🎉 Exciting News from CardanoBI!

We are thrilled to announce that two of our proposals for Project Catalyst Fund 11 have been funded! This milestone will further empower developers and enhance the Cardano ecosystem.

#### 🐍 Python SDK for CardanoBI API
The development of a Python SDK is set to simplify and accelerate the way developers interact with the Cardano blockchain using Python. This tool aims to make blockchain integrations more accessible and efficient.

#### 🦀 Rust SDK for CardanoBI API
Simultaneously, the creation of a Rust SDK will cater to a different segment of our developer community, providing robust and high-performance tools tailored for blockchain applications.

#### 🚀 What This Means for Our Community
The funding of these projects marks a significant commitment to broadening the accessibility and functionality of the CardanoBI platform. Developers can look forward to more streamlined, powerful tools that make building on Cardano easier than ever.
