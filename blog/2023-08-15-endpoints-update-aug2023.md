### 🎉 Today, I'm Glad to Announce a Major Update!

We've released a significant update to our **BI Stats endpoints**. 🚀

#### 📊 Updated Endpoints:
- **Pools Stats**: `/api/bi/pools/stat`
- **Addresses Stats**: `/api/bi/pools/addresses`

#### 📉 Optimization:
The storage requirements for these endpoints have been **optimized by 64%**!

#### 🖥️ Impact on CardanoBI Instances:
For those running their own **CardanoBI** instance for mainnet, here’s the impact:
- **Before**: The underlying caches required `76GB`.
- **After**: The requirement has reduced to `27GB`! 🍃

This update significantly enhances the efficiency of the storage, making the operation of CardanoBI instances much more streamlined! 🚀
