To make our partnership with [Zero Citizen](https://zerocitizen.io) even more fruitful and meaningful we've decided to bring forward our support for Cardano mainnet by a month.

It's been a very busy fortnight for the [**CardanoBI**](https://cardanobi.io) team, but all our efforts paid off:

:::tip Bring it on!
ZC and all **CardanoBI** alpha users will now be able to access mainnet data for their use cases.
