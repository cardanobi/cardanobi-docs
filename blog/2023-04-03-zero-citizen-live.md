I'm absolutely pumped to heard the news that [Zero Citizen](https://zerocitizen.io) have launched the Closed Alpha of their Carbon Balance Service, and in doing so, certified the first ever Cardano project to be carbon neutral!

ZC used **CardanoBI SaaS Service** to calculate the carbon footprint of [FRH](https://filthyrichhorses.io).

Congrats to all teams involved!

:::tip Bring it on!
This is a landmark accomplishment for us in establishing **CardanoBI** as a trusted partner for projects wanting to build utility services on **Cardano**.

But it's only the beginning, stay tuned...
